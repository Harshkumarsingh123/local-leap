Typography hierarchy is clear with massive uppercase headings and light, readable body text. The overall aesthetic is minimal yet impactful, combining modernity with an artistic edge, suitable for creative and cultural brands.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color for key headings, call-to-action blocks, and emphasis elements to draw immediate attention. The 'primaryForeground' color should be used for text and icons placed on the 'primary' background to ensure clear readability. The 'secondary' color serves as a grounding tone for backgrounds, text blocks, and navigation elements, paired with 'secondaryForeground' for text to maintain contrast and warmth. The 'background' color provides a neutral, soft canvas that balances the stronger colors and supports content legibility. The 'highlightYellow' custom color is best used for large background sections or accent areas to create visual interest and break up the layout. Colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain strong contrast and accessibility, with 'primary' and 'secondary' colors never used together without sufficient spacing or neutral buffer.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' background meets WCAG AA standards for large text and AAA for normal text. The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' background also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios for body text. The 'background' color paired with 'secondary' and 'primary' colors provides sufficient contrast for readability. The 'highlightYellow' should be used with 'secondary' or 'primaryForeground' text to maintain accessibility compliance."
